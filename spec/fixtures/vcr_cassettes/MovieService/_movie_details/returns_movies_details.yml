        Angry channels aggression nicely...\r\n\r\nTrue Story. All my friends are
        golfers, however, it''s not a sport for me. I played with them once after
        they continued to badger me about it, at a par 4 hole I used a putter instead
        of a driver to get onto the green, literally just whacked it straight and
        hard, I holed in 3, much to my friend''s consternation!!\r\n\r\nThe purpose
        of that story is why I enjoyed Happy Gilmore so much, it takes fun pot shots
        at the sport whilst daftly proclaiming that any dude can play in his own style.
        This is an absolutely no brain movie of course, with a plot as daft as it
        sounds - a failed/angry ice-hockey player takes up golf to earn money to save
        his granny''s house from being repossessed - and of course he becomes a cause
        célèbre to the golfing curates.\r\n\r\nSandler has and always will be an acquired
        comedy taste, making this very much one for his fans only. And truth be told
        this is basic Sandler where he''s shouty and sweary, and he certainly improved
        on a filmic level from this point on. So what you gonna do? I laughed a lot,
        but you see I''m a Sandler fan (though there are some films of his I positively
        hate), it cheered me up and sometimes that''s all I want from one of his movies.
