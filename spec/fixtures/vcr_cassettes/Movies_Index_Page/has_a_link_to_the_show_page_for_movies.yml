        birds aren''t meant to be caged.\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written
        and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella
        Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman,
        the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced
        to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his
        wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship
        he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things
        start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his
        talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly
        change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put
        out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn''t give
        much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures
        unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box
        office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations,
        and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home
        entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally
        found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions
        as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans,
        whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though,
        is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues
        to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt''s
        possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into
        cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that
        makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that
        dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn,
        and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama
        that''s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed
        there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering
        of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance.
        The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration,
        surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better)
        & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it''s the easiest thing in the world
        to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren''t faring too bad either.
        Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart
        achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as
        antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston
        is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there''s Roger Deakins'' lush cinematography
        as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal
        hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction
        with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman''s score is mostly
        piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy''s state of mind, while the excellently
        selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous
        Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it''s a love
        that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger
        - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce
        the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank
        offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and
        a better world for all of us. 10/10","created_at":"2016-07-10T00:16:50.561Z","id":"578193f29251417c28001764","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:48.710Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/578193f29251417c28001764"},{"author":"tmdb73913433","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb73913433","avatar_path":null,"rating":6.0},"content":"Make

        lies the problem. Most of the time, the killer is the husband, and most of
        the time the right man is in prison.\r\nJuries are now doomed to consist of
        several people who are brainwashed by this constant propaganda Hollywood gives
        us and think accordingly.\r\nPeople are not gods. They are souls and spirits
        that can only withstand so much brainwashing. \r\nAdd to that, the story plods
        along with really nothing new to add. It''s a very formula movie.\r\nI won''t
        say it is a \"bad movie\". Those are ones I give 1 or 2 out of 10. But 3/10
        is what I call the very boring, unimaginative, safe, non thought provoking
        movies that you forget about quite quickly.","created_at":"2023-04-03T15:38:39.540Z","id":"642af2ffc0a30800774eb399","updated_at":"2023-04-03T16:46:12.393Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/642af2ffc0a30800774eb399"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":9}}'
