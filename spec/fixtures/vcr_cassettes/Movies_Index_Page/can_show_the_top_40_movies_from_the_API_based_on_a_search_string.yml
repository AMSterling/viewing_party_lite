        with \"Mermaidman and Barnacleboy II,\" in which SpongeBob gets a chance to
        play superhero with two slightly geriatric TV idols (voiced by Ernest Borgnine
        and Tim Conway). Then tensions and tail fins flare in \"Bubble Buddy,\" as
        SpongeBob irks everyone with his provocative new best friend: a silent--yet
        rather demanding--bubble. Surprisingly witty, fast-paced humor and fresh,
        detailed animation make watching each quirky show a visual and auditory treat.
        But the great lure of SpongeBob is that his dilemmas relate equally well to
        young and old.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2003-03-04","title":"Spongebob
