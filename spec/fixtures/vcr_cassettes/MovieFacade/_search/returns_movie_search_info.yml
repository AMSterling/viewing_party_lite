        with Wayne’s Deer, a portrait of Wayne Bruhm, amateur naturalist and hunter.
        Wayne’s ancestors first settled along the LaHave River, Nova Scotia in 1723,
        and he has spent hours quietly hidden in these woods watching deer movements
        for decades. Beforehand he takes such precautions as using his own time tested
        formula made from boiled hakmatack needles and other substances to mask his
        scent. Indeed Wayne probably knows more about deer than most biologists with
        PhD’s. And every Fall he shoots one deer for meat. Wayne’s Deer was patiently
        shot over four seasons and tells a refreshingly honest story of living with
        nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2015-09-20","title":"Wayne''s

        Dyer: The Power of Intention","overview":"In Dr. Wayne Dyer''s public television
        special, taped live in front of a thousand fans in Boston''s historic theater
        district, he transforms conventional thinking about making things happen in
        our lives into a profound understanding of how each person possesses the infinite
        potential and power to co-create the life he or she desires. To accomplish
        this, Dr. Dyer takes the audience through a journey into the seven faces of
        intention - 1: creativity, 2: kindness; 3: love, 4: beauty, 5: expansiveness,
        6: abundance, and 7: receptivity. Throughout the program, Dr. Dyer illustrates
        his points with signature stories that move the audience to tears--as well
        as abundant laughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2003-05-14","title":"Wayne
